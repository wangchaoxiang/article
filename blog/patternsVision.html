						<p>The software industry is still relatively young. However
							most of the design problems occurring today have already been
							solved hundreds of times before in various software systems.
							Some of the solutions may have been great and worked well in
							production while some of them may have been substandard and
							produced various kinds of bugs pestering the end users.
						<p>What if we could take the best solution out of the several
							hundred and reuse it everywhere? This standard solution would be
							of proven quality in several areas: correctness, efficiency,
							reliability, security, maintainability, testability, flexibility
							etc. Without doubt the overall benefits would be enormous. The
							wheel would no longer be reinvented in every code shop which
							would save time and resources throughout the lifecycle of the
							produced software.
						<p>
							These industry's best solutions already exist and they have a
							common name: design patterns. The importance of patterns in
							crafting complex systems has been long recognized in other
							disciplines. In particular, Christopher Alexander
							and his colleagues were perhaps the first to propose
							the idea of using a pattern language to architect buildings and
							cities. In short, the concept of the design pattern in software
							provides a key to helping developers leverage the expertise of
							other skilled architects.
						<p>
							The legendary Gang of Four started the software design pattern
							catalog twenty years ago with their ground breaking book 
							Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software. 
							Over the years, many more books have been published on the same
							topic. Some of the most influencial are Martin Fowler's Patterns of
							Enterprise Application Architecture and Pattern-Oriented
							Software Architecture series by Buschmann et al. Some of the
							patterns have never made it to the pages of a book but live only
							in the Internet as a white paper. The book and white paper
							publishing formats are not ideal for the practising coder. The
							design patterns are first and foremost code and code lives in
							repositories where it can be checked out, reviewed, executed,
							enhanced and tested using the industry standard tools.
						<p>With the advent of Java 8 functional programming most of
							the classic design patterns as written by the original authors
							have become obsolete. With modern programming style we can
							mostly avoid deep class hierarchies and abstract base classes.
							The style has changed from passing values to passing behavior in
							shape of functions. The verbosity of the classic Java vanishes
							as anonymous classes turn into nimble one-liner lambdas.
						<p>Enter the Java Design Patterns open source community
							project. We strive to offer the most comprehensive catalog of
							top quality design patterns on Internet. All the patterns have
							been documented, categorized and tagged by their properties so
							they are easy to find and study. Our focus is to provide sample
							code of highest standard. Every commit runs automatic build
							tests, code style tests and static analysis. Unlike the patterns
							published in books and white papers our code is not static but
							lives and evolves with every new Java version.
						<p>In addition to high quality sample code we strive to
							provide you a pleasant open source experience. Should you want
							to contribute, we will answer your questions and be nice to you.
							No matter if you are just starting your career as a programmer
							or already are a seasoned developer we have suitable tasks for
							your skill level. Java Design Patterns is one of the best
							projects in Github to learn modern Java, software design and
							architecture.
